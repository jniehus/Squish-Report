python convertTest.py

This will generate an 'output' directory which contains all the html files.
Note that the HTML references the .js and .css files UP one directory.  You

REPORT_START, DETAILS_START, and REPORT_END strings

Note:
It seems Chrome is shortcutting some javascript so it requires a refresh to get the navigation buttons working along with some of the div layouts.

{
  var count = 0;
  for (var i in this.values)
    {
      count++;
